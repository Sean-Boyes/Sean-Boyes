### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an Engineering Student studying at Simon Fraser University, working in embedded electonics and pcb design.
I enjoy solving problems and learning from them, as well as optmizing code/designs.

My main interests are low level and pcb design.
My current goals that I am working towards are creating a motherboard for a mobile device using the RK3588 SOC, and designing an affordable, opensource pick-and-place machine with a heated bed.
